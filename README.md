# liri_node_app


### Overview

This CLI app will utilize the terminal window in order to get information for the user in a similar way that Siri is used on the Iphone to do searches through voice commands. However, for LIRI, the commands will come from command line in the terminal. 

### Functions

1. In order to find concert information, the user must input 'node liri concert-this "band name"' and the terminal will display the upcoming shows for the band searched. 

2. If the user wants to find information about a specific song, the user must input 'node liri spotify-this-song "user search"' and the terminal will display the name of the artist, the name of the song, the album which the song is featured in, and the link to play it on spotify.

3. If the user wants to find information about a specific movie, the user must input 'node liri movie-this "movie name"' and the terminal will display the name of the movie, genre, ratings, actors featured in the movie, and a brief summary of the movie.

4. Finally, if the user types "node liri do-what-it-says", the terminal will read the document 'random.txt' and will run the function that is written in the document.
